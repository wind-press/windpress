WindPress is packed full of features designed to streamline your workflow. Some of our favorites are:

* **Dual Tailwind CSS version**: Tailwind CSS `3.x` and `4.x` ready.
* **Plug and play**: Start using Tailwind CSS in WordPress in seconds — no setup is required.
* **Customizable Configuration**: The plugin comes with a default Tailwind CSS configuration, but you can easily customize it to fit your needs.
* **Easy to use**: Simplified and intuitive settings to get you up and running quickly.
* **Lightweight**: The plugin dashboard built on top of WordPress REST API, and a modern JavaScript framework for an instant, responsive user experience. Yet it has a small footprint and won't slow down your site.
* **Blazingly fast**: Cache makes your WordPress site blazing fast. Generate the final optimized CSS file in the browser without server-side tools. None of your data is transferred over the network.

And some specific integrations also include the following features:
