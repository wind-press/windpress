== Description ==

### WindPress: the #1 Tailwind CSS v4 integration plugin for WordPress.

WindPress is packed full of features designed to streamline your workflow. Some of our favorites are:

* **Customizable Configuration**: The plugin comes with a default Tailwind CSS configuration, but you can easily customize it to fit your needs.
* **Easy to use**: Simplified and intuitive settings to get you up and running quickly.
* **Lightweight and blazingly fast**: The plugin dashboard built on top of WordPress REST API, and a modern JavaScript framework for an instant, responsive user experience. It has a small footprint and won't slow down your site.
